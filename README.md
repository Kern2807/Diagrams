## Diagrams
Give explaination
## Setup
* How did you setup diagram module and graphvix on your machine
# diagramex.py
* Just a example diagram for testing purposes, nothing less
# ![diagramproject.py](diagrams_image.png)
* The code for the diagram and the output
# diagramproject2.py and diagrams_image2.png
* The same code and same output but with colored arrows
## What improvement
